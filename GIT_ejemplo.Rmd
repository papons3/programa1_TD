```

## Calculo del area de un circulo
```{r}
r<- 2
A<- pi*r^2
print(A)
```

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
